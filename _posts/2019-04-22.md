Going home day for me. Nnnnnnnnn.

Ottawa airport was so empty today that I got to go through the gate at the latest possible moment. You were also able to watch my plane take off. That’s not too bad, I guess, as it’s much less sad than the other airport goodbyes we’ve had.

I don’t really have much to write for today, as most of my day was spent on a plane. It does however, feel like no time passed at all for this long weekend. Seriously, where did all the time go?

I’d like to think that every day that passes with you is one day closer to being together. One day closer to buying just a one-way ticket to wherever you are. 

This weekend really felt like we picked it up where we left off in January, but with a 200% boost in confidence. I really can’t dream of being with anyone better than you, so you’re here to stay with me. I know I’ve hit the jackpot, and I’m not about to throw away this winning ticket.
