Nothing specifically happened today. But it’s true that your letters to your future self inspired me to stop and take a moment to think about what’s happened in the last 5 years. 

The recap really let me see how much I’ve changed, even within the same year. It also showed me how lucky I am to be in the position I’m in right now, and I’ve realized that I’m starting to like myself, just a little bit. 

Thank you for bringing out the best in me, and for believing in me. I hope I can continue to be someone you’re proud of.
