I’m sure whatever memories we have of when we first met two years ago might be affected by a little bit of bias from how we feel about each other now. However that may be, I’m happy that we have a positive memory of that time, which means we really never had any bad underlying things to work through.

The two years following that, I think it was necessary. For me anyways, I’m not sure I really knew what was important to me in 2016, and if I didn’t experience everything that happened in the last two years, I’m not sure I’d be able to appreciate you nearly as much right now. When I met you, I probably didn’t know at the time that you were the one I needed in my life all along, but I sure as hell know that know.

I’m glad we did get to know each other as friends, and that we like each other again after all this time. I’m happy that you still like me, even if the real me is awkward, makes bad jokes, and has bad sleeping habits. I couldn’t really find any faults, besides maybe the fact that you’re not here with me, so I knew that I had to ask you out before everyone else started realizing that you were perfect. 

That day was an exciting day, but I don’t think either of us knew that it was a meeting that would change our lives quite this much. I like you more and more each day, and I don’t think there’s a cap I’ll hit anytime soon.
