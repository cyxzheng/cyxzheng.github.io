If you’re reading this, let me just apologize again for upsetting you in this way. I really didn’t expect it to go the way it did.

Long story short, I asked Alice about when I should visit, and she asked me to not tell you that she was not gonna tell you that’s what I asked about. When you found out, you were very upset that you had waited so long for nothing. 

It was a really long hour on the video call, and it sucks because I could only look at you and not comfort you any other way. However, after some time passed, we were able to continue on with the day as if nothing had really happened. Well, it did happen, but it wasn’t something that hung over our heads. It passed.

It’s a magical thing, that our resolution of these things happen same day. I mean, I really hope I don’t ever purposely upset you or do something massively disappointing, but it’s good to know that we can solve problems. Well, maybe you can solve problems because you’re the one with the logic. This is why I need you; my emotional self is quite useless during these things. 

Confidence is apparently also built when less savoury things happen. Truly some power couple dynamics.
