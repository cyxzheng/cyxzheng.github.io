We talked a bit about Facebook Dating and you said you wanted to try it. I knew it was curiosity and nothing malicious, but part of me still felt uncomfortable with it. 

I did tell you that... but I was a little worried that you’d be upset by that fact for some reason. But I told myself that I wanted to be transparent about how I felt, so I braced myself for your response.

When you replied, you simply acknowledged my concern and said that you wouldn’t do it then. 

???

That was... really simple? It felt really odd. I guess when two level-headed people have a relationship and actually communicate, this is the result?

It’s also a great indicator of how my previous relationships were I guess, if I had to worry about being open with how I feel. I’m really glad that we’re building something healthy here.

And, of course, being told that you can’t find anyone better than me definitely makes my day... and gives me butterflies. Still not sure what I did in a previous life to have ended up with someone so amazing.
