The night before your first day of work was also the night that I would wait at the airport for a delayed plane back to San Francisco. 

You asked if we could call, and I said yes... of course! All for making you feel better in a new, unfamiliar place... but truthfully, I also felt like I needed to hear your voice too to comfort myself. 

I love that talking with you is a magical remedy for a lot of my worries and bad feelings. I’m really glad I’m not going through such a strange and unsure time in my life alone, and I hope I can provide you that sense of comfort and security too.
