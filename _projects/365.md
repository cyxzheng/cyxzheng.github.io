# Why?

It started when I failed to secure any interviews during the first round of internship applications at school. I was able to see the gap in visual design skills between me and my peers, and I didn't want to fall even farther behind.

I knew that it was impossible that I'd be able to catch up overnight, so I opted to take the slow and steady path of creating something (didn't matter what) every day. Instead of aiming for perfection on day 1, I would practice and slowly build up my foundational skills to put myself in a better place a year from the start date.

# The beginning

The early ones were pretty basic. I focused primarily on illustrations and working in Adobe Illustrator, for no particular reason other than I thought it was a lot of fun. I would try to emulate some of my favourite illustrators and incorporate things about their style that I liked into my own work. This was a period of me getting more familiar with Illustrator.

# Trying new things

At this point, I didn't have too much experience with UI design, and wanted to become more proficient at Sketch as well, having learned that it's the industry standard UI design tool. Within my challenge, I also started the [Daily UI Challenge](http://www.dailyui.co/){:target="_blank"}, and having the extra 100 prompts was a nice bonus as well.

# In motion

I put off learning After Effects for about 3 years, as it looked like an intimidating piece of software. I smacked myself and started with some tutorials and simpler animations. Great choice on my part, because it turns out I really enjoy making things move and come to life.

# There were bad days...

Life sometimes gets in the way, whether it be a school project, work obligations, family things, or just a case of "not feeling it".

I think what kept me sane was being able to accept that I won't absolutely love everything that I make, and that the goal of this challenge was to do work everyday in order to incrementally improve. It was still valuable for me to post the... less nice ones, so that I could be completely transparent about my progress.

<p>Funnily enough, some of the ones I spend barely any time on get more "likes" than the ones I put real effort into.</p>
</div>

# There were split days...

There were also days when I split a project into two days. I actually sort of liked doing this sometimes, because it allowed me to go more into detail and create a better "final" version.

# And there were good days

Of course there were good days. I definitely had more than a few that I was properly proud of. Even more so near the last 1/3 of the year, when I started to become a lot more proficient in my design tools, and was starting to find a style that I liked.

# The end?

I didn't continue to post in the same frequency after the year ended, but still did whenever I made something cool. No longer constrained by a quota or time limit, I aimed for quality instead of quantity on the things I posted this year.

# So, what did you learn?

You won't like everything that you make, and when learning new skills, the first couple attempts will almost never be great. I don't think I'll ever be at a point where I think I'm "good enough", but the having a mentality of chasing improvement instead of perfection really motivated me to keep on going.

I learned that some sacrifices had to be made; I spent less time on other hobbies, on my friends and family, and sometimes on sleep, but I kept going on the basis that breaking t his commitment would haunt my dreams for the rest of my life.

All jokes aside, giving myself some leeway with deadlines was definitely neccessary to keeping sane.

Effort in itself is a valuable quality. The willingness to put in the hours to get better at something applies to more than just design, and I've since gained confidence in knowing that I can learn anything I set my mind to. Maybe I'll tackle lettering next, or mathematics, or learning another instrument. Who knows. But I know I'll be able to apply the same principles of effort and consistency to learning those things too.

This project also brought me some really cool opportunities, as I now currently lead design at a San Francisco startup; the variety of skills I learned has benefitted me immensely as the only designer on an early-stage team.

Big improvements really do happen in small steps.
