blurb: On January 1, 2017, I committed myself to creating something everyday for the entire year, posting it onto my Instagram in order to keep myself accountable. I had no goal for this challenge other than to complete it, so I took it as an opportunity to also explore different avenues of design, such as illustration, UI design, and animation. </br></br> This is the story of my year-long journey to improvement.
