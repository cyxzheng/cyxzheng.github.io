# Is this where I talk about myself?

I'm a designer from Vancouver, currently taking a two-year break from my studies at the University of Waterloo to do back-to-back internships instead; more-or-less playing hooky. I've designed for [Manulife](https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html){:target="_blank"}, [Symbility Intersect](https://www.symbilitysolutions.com/symbility-intersect/){:target="_blank"}, and I'm currently working with startups and new ideas at [HVF Labs](http://hvflabs.com){:target="_blank"} in San Francisco.

I'm happiest when working on something that captivates me. Currently, I'm working with an amazing founding team to build a better bank in the US.
