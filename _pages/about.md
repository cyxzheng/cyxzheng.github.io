# Is this where I talk about myself?

I'm a designer from Vancouver, currently taking a two-year break from my studies at the University of Waterloo to do back-to-back internships instead; more-or-less playing hooky. I've designed for Manulife, Symbility Intersect, and I'm currently working with startups and new ideas at HVF Labs in San Francisco.

I'm happiest when working on something that captivates me. Currently, I'm working with an amazing founding team to build a better bank in the US.

Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, cooking, exploring the city, and advocating for calling milk tea with pearls "bubble tea" instead of "boba".
