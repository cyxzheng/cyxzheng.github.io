# Is this where I talk about myself?

I'm a designer from Vancouver, currently taking a two-year break from my studies at the University of Waterloo to do back-to-back internships instead; more-or-less playing hooky. I've designed for [Manulife](https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html){:target="_blank"}, [Intersect](https://www.weareintersect.com){:target="_blank"}, [HVF Labs](https://hvflabs.com){:target="_blank"}, and most recently, [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com){:target="_blank"}
