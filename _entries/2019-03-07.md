Today was our 6 months! At the beginning, I thought that 6 months, let alone a year, felt like such a long ways away, but the day came and went at an amazing speed.

In the last 6 months, we:

Saw each other on 17 days

Travelled together once

Spent many weekends together over FaceTime/FB/Skype

Probably racked up a lot of server costs for those companies

Talked every single day

Missed each other single day

Decided with sufficient evidence that we’ve found “the one”

The extremely accurate statistics don’t say too much, but the point is, even with that small hurdle of being at least a few hundred miles away from each other, we’ve gotten closer to each other than I could’ve possibly imagined on Sept 7, 2018. The more I learn about you, the more time I spend with you, the more we talk about… all of that adds to how much I love you. You’re no longer an ideal, because all the things I could’ve possibly wanted are all real.

There was also a slight hiccup today with Jeffery Zhao. I don’t like him (or the way he talks to you), but I’m definitely not mad at you for keeping around a toxic friend. I know it’s hard to let that go. I’m proud of you for trying to not get yourself back into this hole today by removing him. I will support you 100% all the time, and will always be honest with you, especially for the difficult to talk about things.

Here’s to many more 6 months
