Winter holiday festivals are always the same every year. The same lights, attractions, food… the difference this year was that I got to go with you.

I think we’re both still getting used to this taking pictures together thing. Understandable, since it’s not like we have a chance to practice normally anyways. We did get a few nice photos; I think we look good together. Took a while though, because only one person knew how to take photos properly. 

I know I wish that spending time together is something we can always do, but I guess the one benefit of waiting is that it just feels that much more special when it happens. When you know that you don’t get unlimited hugs/kisses/time spend holding hands, you make it count.

I’m glad we decided to spend the four days together. Even now it doesn’t feel like quite enough time.
