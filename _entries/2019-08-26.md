We convinced ourselves that we would do the Grouse Grind, and we were actually really excited for it too. There were dreams and aspirations of getting to the top in less than an hour, fueled by the fact that we had hiked 4 times this summer on hikes that were not easy. I was definitely feeling optimistic.

I forgot how bad it was to drive downtown during the day, and this was made worse by the fact that missing W Georgia meant we had to go through a bunch of stop signs. Thankfully, the detour didn't take too long, and we were on track to Grouse Mountain immediately!! 

Side note, your shoes fit perfectly. I'm so glad they fit, because returning these would have been near impossible. 

As soon as I finished the first stretch of the Grouse Grind, I realized that we were probably not going to be able to do this under an hour. I put on a brave face the whole time, but truthfully, I was close to dying as well. We did manage to pass everyone and leave them in the dust, so I think compared to the average Grouse Grind goer, we did pretty good. No more Grouse Grind though, because the view was not nearly as rewarding as all the other hikes we did... no mailbox this time for me to slap a sticker onto. You're right in that we need to go on new hikes - I can't wait for the rest of the hiking pictures we'll take that make people jealous. 

I was wondering how we would fill up the time after we climbed up, but you said that we probably wouldn't have any spare time left. In taking pictures, and waiting for our Beavertail, we managed to catch the Lumberjack Show at just the right moment. I've never watched it before, because every time I came up the Grouse Grind in the past, I was never there at the exact time when the show ran. It was so much fun watching the show with you, because the director's commentary you provided added an extra dimension to the show. Would I watch it again? Probably not. But I'm glad that the first (and only) time I watched this show was with you.

We decided not to eat on the mountain, and settled for Costco fries before heading to our real dinner. The drive to Costco took about 40 minutes, because of the four lanes having to merge into one on the Lion's Gate bridge. Not a bad thing to be stuck in traffic with you though, because it makes holding hands so much less stressful than if I was driving on the highway. 

Eventually we made it to Costco, and found parking right outside. Dunno how we always find parking right away, but it's not a bad hidden superpower to have. We tried out those new payment kiosks, got our food, and marveled at how good the meal was for less than $10.

After Costco, we walked around Yaletown for a bit, and we went inside the new Parq. I wanted to try a slot machine, because I had never played one before, so I broke your $20, broke it into $5s, put a $5 into the machine, slapped the button, and the total jumped up to $6.82. I had heard way too many stories about people gambling and letting it go to zero and losing everything, so I immediately cashed out. It looked like I was over the moon, and I was, because the thrill of winning money, even $1.82, was still a thrill. Even doubly so because you were there to witness it. I never thought about walking away as an amazing thing, but I'm glad we established today that I probably won't lose everything we have to gambling in the future. 

We went back to Mister and Basil Pasta Bar after 3 years, and it's a little hard to believe that in three years, this is how we would be. Back then we were a little different, and didn't pay too much attention to photographing food, but the love of eating good food has always remained constant. Not expensive food, necessarily, but good food. Quite important, seeing as it's one of the things (besides sleeping) that we'll spend a lot of time doing together. 

Before dropping you off at home, we parked at LaFarge to act like teenagers for a bit. While it's not the same as what we've been able to do this entire summer, it's much better than nothing at all, and I think we actually get more private time together than a lot of other couples our age. Once the teenager stuff starts, it's really hard to stop, and getting you home before 10 pm didn't happen.

Thinking back on this day, it felt like two separate days, because we usually would just hike for the whole day, and come back home at night. You're right, we really didn't have to find ways to fill the time, because it always happens whether we plan for it or not, and it was such an amazing day once again. It's a bit bittersweet, being our last hike for a while, but I think the more things we do together that we'll enjoy, the more we have to look forward to, because chances are we'll go hiking again next year, and the year after that, and so on. Thanks for another magical day.
