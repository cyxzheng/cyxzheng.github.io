Short call this week. It really wasn’t that much shorter though, because it’s a Sunday and we have work the next day. But still shorter by a bit.

When I see you is when I miss you a whole lot. Your voice is so nice to listen to, and it makes my day seeing you too. Probably because you’re beautiful. 

You went out with Sabrina and got a little drunk. I’m really sorry that I indirectly make you sad when you’re drunk. I know it was selfish of me to ask you out and then leave... but I don’t regret that choice one bit; I’m really glad you’re by my side.

Even when drunk, you can calm me right down. That’s gotta be a superpower, right?

I really do hope that this all works out. Nothing that’s worth it is easy, right?
