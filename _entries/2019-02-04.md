How is it that my excitement to see you hasn’t died down one bit since we started dating? 

Seriously, I could probably just stare at you for the whole day and not do anything else. Finally, I don’t have to quickly glance down when you look at me, because you’re mine.

On that fateful day, I think I looked at you and basically thought “yep, she’s prettier than I deserve.” Still true to this day, by the way; I look at you with heart eyes all the time.

I miss you so much. Thank god Facebook is nice to us and doesn’t cut our call off when we leave it on the whole night.
