There was a 15 minute call for “live commentary” on our old chat logs when it was 11 PM for you… but not much live commentary happened, and the call definitely lasted longer than 15 minutes. 

Seeing you makes me miss you more than I already do… but I also need to see you so I don’t go insane. This is probably a form of torture somewhere.

You’re also the first person to actually compliment me and call me cute and I feel like that still throws me off to this day… because when you said that during the call, I said something stupid about finally getting a haircut that I liked. But it really makes me feel nice and warm inside… and it encourages me to learn how to dress a bit better so I don’t look like poo standing next to you.

The start of the year really does feel a bit slow, but we’ll hopefully look back one day and see that everything we have to endure was worth it.
