This was "ride a bike around Stanley Park" day. 

Things did not unfortunately go without a hitch. We went to Zabu Chicken and the waiters forgot to put in our order... so we waited about an hour for chicken to come out. The chicken was good, but I had to begrudgingly accept that, because I was really unhappy with the way that they basically didn't even show a sense of urgency for messing up. Unfortunately (fortunately?) I'm not really one to make a scene in public, so we just ate and left.

Biking itself was really fun. I'm glad my mom gave me the chance to learn how to bike all those years ago, because it's such a good skill to have for situations like this. This includes things like skating, or rollerblading... all things deemed unacceptable for guys to not know how to do.

Afterwards we went to a sketchy McDonald's to get soft serve and fries. We sat by English Bay for a bit, before I drove you home.

I somehow thought today would be a day that I could get you home earlier than 11... and I was wrong again. There's just something about spending time together that makes it go by so fast.
