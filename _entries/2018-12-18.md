We’re eating at Momofuku in about 12 days. In Vegas. When did this date get so close? I still can’t believe it’s real sometimes - probably not until we get on the plane.

The holidays is an iffy time for plans, but I’m still happy that I get half the holiday with you. I’m not sure I can ever actually see you enough, to be honest, so I’ll likely always complain about the amount of days we get together. We’ll make the time count though, we always do.

And… countdown to giving you your Christmas present. I really really really hope you like it, because it’s definitely a bit of a wild guess still.

What an exciting time; never would have imagined spending the holidays with you. I’m so happy that the year is looking to end on high note.
