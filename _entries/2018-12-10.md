I feel like I tend to worry but I never actually worry about losing you, I just worry about things because I don’t want to lose you. Small difference.

But I also need to write this down so I don’t forget about how much you’ve impacted my life in the short time we’ve been together. You don’t put me down for expressing myself, and you’re patient with me, and you care about my wellbeing. You make me feel loved and secure even from 900 or so miles away. There’s no hint of doubt in your voice when you say that it’ll be ok when we look at Ottawa. I’m so incredibly lucky that you’re mine. I hope I can make you feel the same way.
