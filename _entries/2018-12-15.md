Calls are dangerous. They make time go by at twice the speed. 

I wish for one day being able to say goodnight, and still see you there beside me in the morning. Soon this will be a reality, so I’m pretty excited.

Also, whenever you throw in a compliment when we’re calling, I squirm a little in happiness. Forgive the silence, I’m usually just a little too happy to think of a response.

Thanks for making my dull days brighter.
