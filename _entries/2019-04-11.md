I’ve never really enjoyed my birthday in the last few years. It always happened during finals season, and my family is generally just not that big on celebrating birthdays in the first place. It’s a pretty ordinary day for me, but secretly, every year I just hope for a good day. I don’t really know what exactly I was hoping for before, but I never felt “happy”.

I think every year when I did celebrate in some way, it always felt like the people celebrating with me were more excited about my birthday than I was. I also shared it with Ariba for three years, and then last year that wasn’t a thing anymore. Very fun indeed.

This year, I had a good day. I woke up to a nice message from you, had cake at work, had hot pot with 2/3 friends, and ended off the day by opening up your letter containing surprise Cirque du Soleil tickets. It sounds like a very ordinary day, but this was probably the best birthday I had in a while. I felt cared about, important, and so lucky that I have you as my girlfriend.  I really didn’t know what I would’ve wanted for my birthday, but once again, you got me exactly what I didn’t know I wanted.

Slowly but surely, you’re bringing joy back into certain aspects of my life.
