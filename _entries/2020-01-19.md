title: 'Putting up with me'
---

Lately it feels like I’ve been a handful, and I’m really grateful that you still treat me like your baby. Not much to say here, I guess, but I feel really grateful that I don’t fear being myself when I’m around you. Without you, I would get over bad moods much more slowly, and sleeping would be much more difficult if you weren’t on a screen beside me.

A lot of what you do for me isn’t always tangible, but they’re important nonetheless. Making time to call each week, always sending good nights with hearts, sending me things on the Internet that you thought were interesting… if you take it all away, you take away a lot of the things in my life that I’ve come to rely on for happiness.

Thanks for dealing with me when I’m a handful and in bad moods. I don’t know how I was ever happy before you came along, but I imagine this is what life is like when you upgrade from black and white to colour.
