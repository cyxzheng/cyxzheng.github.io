title: 'Self-isolation with you'
---

I feel like I mostly write these things when we’re apart for some time and something happens and I want to remember it but I think these past two weeks we’ve spent a record-breaking amount of time together consecutively… over Skype.

The real thing would be better of course, but right now is not a great time for anyone to leave their house and go hang out with other people, so Skype actually is the logical way to spend time together right now. This is probably going to be the case when I get home, too.

It’s been pretty great, actually. I sleep and wake up now at consistent times (though, still considered odd hours), and I always feel like I have company throughout the day that I don’t get sick of. I think if I actually did this self-isolation thing by myself, I wouldn’t be in great shape and my mind will probably make me think things that make me sad, sort of like what happened over reading week in the Fall term. At least here, if we do get sad, it doesn’t stick.

In a time of uncertainty, it’s nice to have this one certain thing that persists throughout everyday. It’s a nice routine to have when everything seems to be collapsing into a sinkhole. 

I miss Hawai’i, and I’m still sad that our summer plans are put on the shelf. But those will happen in the future. I’m glad I have you still.
