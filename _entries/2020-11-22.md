I was very happy doing data entry for you while you marked your midterms. I love seeing you do something that you’re good at, and in this case it’s you being smart. Once again two years later we’re still able to do almost anything and be happy. I feel like it’s actually a really exciting thing to know that we’ll be moving in together soon, because hopefully that means the daily things that we normally do become better for no apparent reason except for the fact that we’re now doing it together. 

I wish you didn’t have to leave. During this time seeing you stressed out is when I hate leaving you to yourself the most. Can’t wait to see you tomorrow though, hopefully the coffee will rejuvenate you a little bit!
