It was a long week, but we unexpectedly decided to watch a movie today. It was “Dumplin’”, and it was a nice, wholesome, coming-of-age movie. 

Your Christmas present also came today in the mail. It’s so hard to not tell you about it; I would have ordered it later, but didn’t want to risk something delaying it… and it actually did get delayed so I’m glad I ordered it early.

The first weekend I came back to SF was the first time we called each other. I, at the time, wasn’t really expecting calls, let alone weekly calls. I think I still hated calls, because the previous experience was a lot of calling just for the sake of calling, and not because there was anything to talk about… but now this is something that I really look forward to every week. You definitely got me hooked… not onto the calls, per se, but onto you. It’s always so hard to hang up.

We also looked through the two weeks of winter vacation, and… there really isn’t that much time, even in two weeks. A bit sad, but we do get a whole trip together to Vegas, and probably other days too. It’s a little overwhelming to think beyond December too, because it really seems like next year will be much more difficult than the last three months. I’m sure it’ll be fine, and we’ll both be putting in the effort to make it work… but I do want more time with you. I think it’s actually not too outlandish an ask, because if you think about it, we can measure all the time we’ve actually spent together in days (probably less than 5 at this point). I don’t know. It just feels a little overwhelming seeing how blank the future is. But I guess that means we have all the chances to write our story the way we want. 

3 months… felt a lot longer than 3 months. I’m sure some of it has to do with how busy we are, but I hope we have 3 more months, followed by 3 more, followed by… you get the idea. No end date in sight. Not sure if it’s good for me to think this so early, but… your fault for being such a catch!

I hope there are many more happy moments, and also many more moments spent together. I really do hope that this all works out. Love is such a great thing, and I’m glad that you’re the one I love.
