It’s going to be handmade, but it’s really giving me trouble. This is the first time I’ve made this thing, so hopefully it turns out decent. I spent so long today having to untangle the material because… it tangled. It was like, 4 hours at least to untangle the whole thing. 

It’s a lot of fun so far at least, and it’s satisfying, but it’s probably one of the most difficult things I will have made for you so far. It turns out I’m not actually that great with my hands, especially for the more detailed things… so I definitely envy all the nice cards and crafts you’ve made for me over the last two years.

Now that things are in-person, it really feels like we’ve settled more into our relationship, but I’ll still give you gifts because that’s just what you love. Trying my best not to just let things be, because I don’t want to ever get to the point where it feels like things have also simmered down. Always hot and spicy is the way to go, so I’m willing to stay up late and untangle things if it means that. 

I can’t wait to give you this, it’s turning out decently, even though it’s been difficult to make.
