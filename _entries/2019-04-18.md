Today was the day! Except today was also a “things went wrong in the most perfect way” kind of day.

My flight was delayed by four hours, because of some maintenance issue. This meant it looked like I would not make Cirque du Soleil, so we decided that you would just go because you bought the tickets and it wasn’t worth missing it and you could recap for me later.

Fast forward to 8 pm when my flight landed, I decided to just meet you at the show. I didn’t know it would be a two hour long show, so I thought by the time I got there that the show would be done. As it turns out, I got there right during intermission, so I did get to see the second half of the show, and the day was redeemed.

We went to the Airbnb later, and it was a really nice, new, and cozy apartment. I can start to imagine what our space would look like when we get there. 

All the worries of the past week just melted away as soon as I saw you, hugged, you, kissed you, and held your hand. We picked it up right where we left it off four months ago, but with an extra amount of confidence that we built up in the last four months. Doubts? What doubts? This is all going to work out just the way it’s meant to… which is perfectly.
