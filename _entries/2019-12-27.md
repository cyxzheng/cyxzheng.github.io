title: 'Missing you'
---

I never thought just a few days apart could feel like so long.

Some reasons why I miss you:

1. Silence feels less comfortable by myself
2. Food looks and tastes less appetizing without you
3. I can only talk about nothing but also everything with you
4. There are TV shows I don’t want to watch without you
5. You keep me from overthinking
6. You keep me from being sad
7. The future feels less scary when I can see you
8. Being able to touch you is extremely important
9. I think about what I can do better rather than just stewing pointlessly
10. I like the feeling of wanting to give you everything
11. Your eyes put me into a trance
12. Your voice I could listen to forever
13. Car songs sound better when you sing them
14. Driving long distances is painless
15. The more I see you, the harder it is to wait for next time
16. You make me feel like I’m interesting
17. You make my chest feel lighter
18. You make me want to do my best
19. You help me believe in having a happy future 
20. You make me feel loved

I wish that when I miss you most, you could just poof right beside me… or the other way around. Poof. Maybe one day, missing you could just be solved by me going downstairs to sit with you in the living room.
