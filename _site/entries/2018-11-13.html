            <h3>Health relationship</h3>
            <time class="date">November 13, 2018</time>
            <p>We talked a bit about Facebook Dating and you said you wanted to try it. I knew it was curiosity and nothing malicious, but part of me still felt uncomfortable with it.</p>

<p>I did tell you that… but I was a little worried that you’d be upset by that fact for some reason. But I told myself that I wanted to be transparent about how I felt, so I braced myself for your response.</p>

<p>When you replied, you simply acknowledged my concern and said that you wouldn’t do it then.</p>

<p>???</p>

<p>That was… really simple? It felt really odd. I guess when two level-headed people have a relationship and actually communicate, this is the result?</p>

<p>It’s also a great indicator of how my previous relationships were I guess, if I had to worry about being open with how I feel. I’m really glad that we’re building something healthy here.</p>

<p>And, of course, being told that you can’t find anyone better than me definitely makes my day… and gives me butterflies. Still not sure what I did in a previous life to have ended up with someone so amazing.</p>
