            <h3>My favourite person</h3>
            <time class="date">November 3, 2018</time>
            <p>It was a long week; you had a midterm, I had a new monstrous project at work. We didn’t talk too much and I could sense that we were both tired.</p>

<p>On Saturday, you called me on FaceTime right as I was about to jump into the shower. It reminded me that you looked forward to it just as much as I did, that this thing works because we both make it happen. It only reinforced the fact that you’re my favourite person, for making me feel like I matter to you.</p>
