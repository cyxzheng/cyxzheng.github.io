            <h3>Sunset</h3>
            <time class="date">May 30, 2019</time>
            <p>Before today, I thought “watching the sunset” would include something like dinner, or dessert, or something else before/after. We went to go enjoy the sunset on Burnaby Mountain, and that’s the only place we went to today.</p>

<p>I think with everything we did this past week and with all the time we spent together, doing something besides lying down on the grass to watch the sun set would be a bit too much. I saw this as an acceptable form of cuddling in public, because everyone else on the grass was doing it. It was nice, and I don’t think I really wanted to do anything else with you today, because it was a nice break from just go-go-going all the time.</p>

<p>The highlight of this evening was when we sat down in the car, and decided to just people watch. There was a motorcycle dude in front of us, and suddenly another motorcycle dude showed up, and they started talking, and then a group other people came to hang out with them, and there was a drug dealer looking dude who came in a truck. We stayed there for an hour, just watching people come and go, describing what they were doing, but also coming up with stories for them. Being able to come up with so much fun conversation based off of pretty regular things happening in front of us was so enjoyable, and I don’t think there was any other way I wanted to spend the last hour before I drove you home.</p>

<p>It’s not always living the fast life, because we need the slower moments too. Even with the slower moments, it feels like time just passes by so quickly. I’m a little scared about that, because what if before we know it we’re 80 years old? I guess that doesn’t really matter, because I’m sure those 57 years would be extremely enjoyable with you. There’s a lot of people in the world anyways, so plenty of people watching left to do.</p>
