            <h3>The gift of happiness</h3>
            <time class="date">December 11, 2018</time>
            <p>What a Monday. I got slightly drunk with my friend. I also realized that all my worries are always over insignificant things, as usual. From the Facebook game The Test, you guessed correctly that I’m a pessimist… but I’m really trying to change that mindset! I just get a little suspicious sometimes because things are going well for the first time in my life… and sometimes I do think that you’re too good to be true/too good for me. I will do whatever it takes to not lose you.</p>

<p>I called you after your exam, and when you got to your car, the call just continued… all the way until you got home, then it continued until your battery died. As tired as I was near the end, it was such a happy experience to be able to talk to you, so it’s worth whatever pain I feel in the morning. I also got your letter today, too, and smiled all the way from my mailbox to my room.</p>

<p>You don’t have to worry about not doing enough or whatever; you make me happy and you care about me, and that’s really honestly all I need. It’s the best gift I could ever get.</p>
