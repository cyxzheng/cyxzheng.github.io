            <h3>Reunited, part 1</h3>
            <time class="date">November 22, 2018</time>
            <p>How amazing that I got to see you a month early! You looked gorgeous, as usual. It all feels a little surreal that literally the morning of I was still in San Francisco. Sort of like a really good dream that you don’t want to wake up from.</p>

<p>We decided to go sing karaoke - I really didn’t know that all-you-can-sing existed, but we definitely got our money’s worth. Your voice makes me happy, and finally getting to hear it live (and not over FaceTime) was a real treat. Actually, just being there with you was a treat too. I might have lost my ability to write and describe things, to be honest, but I know that whatever I felt while being with you was what I was waiting for these past two months.</p>

<p>That stupid window though. Well, it’s understandable why they would have it there, but it was a little sad to realize that true privacy is actually quite difficult to come by. It didn’t really stop us from making out for a bit, and thankfully we’re both good at restraint in these public settings. Kissing you and being able to actually touch you after so long felt even better than I imagined it would be. For a person who thought the first date wasn’t the day for the first kiss, I’m not sure I can get enough of it now. I’m not really sure I can get enough of you, to be honest.</p>

<p>I’m so lucky that you’re mine. My heart feels so happy.</p>
