            <h3>Existential crisis</h3>
            <time class="date">May 12, 2019</time>
            <p>I think when I write these things, it’s always easy to recall what happened verbatim, but the difficult part is describing the feelings that come paired with the experiences. This was a particularly interesting weekend (and I guess, week), and I’m not really sure why I feel the way I do, so as a result, it would be fitting for me to try and articulate that here… and you’ll get to read it a few months later.</p>

<p>For some reason, I just miss you extra this week. I also just still feel very moody for some reason, like there’s this pinching feeling on my heart constantly. As a result, I feel like I’m on edge for almost everything, and the frustrating thing is, I really don’t know why.</p>

<p>I realize also this is a week for you where you’re sick, and with your period, and you’re definitely tired because of these two reasons, so I still really appreciate that you made the time for me everyday when you had a free moment, as you were juggling settling into a new job, and trying to recover. I think I just tend to get too caught up in whatever thoughts bother me that I forget that this is the situation, until I do something like think about it and write it out.</p>

<p>I went out to lunch with a classmate on Saturday, and when it was time to go, I was very relieved. I felt so awkward the whole time, and it’s just that feeling you get when you don’t quite click with someone. Generally when it comes to social interactions that end like that, I’ll be out of commission for the rest of the day, but I was still okay to Skype with you until we both fell asleep. I realize I don’t really talk to anyone in my life on a daily basis, except for you, and even with all this time spent talking to each other, I’ve never really felt drained. It’s not something I can take for granted, where I can be comfortable with you no matter what. It still surprises me sometimes, because during the times I expect to feel tired, I don’t, so yay for being able to be around each other for longer than your 5 day limit.</p>

<p>We also watched After Life, which I suggested, but it made you sad (sorry). It poked at the side of you that feels an existential crisis, and it definitely wasn’t my intent to make you sad before bedtime, but if you’re reading this and still feeling like life is meaningless, please know that your existence brightens up my little corner of the world, and that means everything to me - even if by that logic, I’m meaningless, but do know that to me, your existence is extremely important.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the past week or so is just me witnessing you adjusting to a new life again, and I’m getting ready to start something new too, so there’s a bit of anxiety and worry to do with “what if the change changes us”. I’ve never loved someone as much as I love you, and I guess part of that is the constant worry of doing something or saying something or having something happen where I might lose you. It’s something I haven’t really experienced before, so I don’t really know how to deal with it. I wish I knew that this was how I felt when you were awake, but I guess you’ll get to hear about it the next time when I do remember to bring it up when I feel like this again. It’s a weird time for me (and for you), and I’m trying to figure things out. Please bear with me for a while - potentially for the rest of our life, because who knows when (and if) I’ll actually figure things out.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure if what I wrote today makes any sense, and it’s a bit different from the usual recap. I also don’t think this really articulates everything (or much of anything), but I do feel a little better writing all of this out. Whenever I worry, I always think back to the time where you sat across from me, held my hand, and told me that you’d never give up on me, and that always brings me back to earth a little bit. I feel like the luckiest guy in the world, and that I’ll be able to get through anything with you by my side.</p>
