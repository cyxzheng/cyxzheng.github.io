    <p>The weekend went by in a flash, with only the Skype timer showing the reality of just how much time we spent together. Sort of. It’s always a little bittersweet knowing that while video calls are close, it’s not quite close enough.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure exactly what we talked about, but there was some good conversation. That’s the beauty of it all, that there’s always something to share. It freaks me out a little bit sometimes, because I wonder if one day it’ll just stop, but since you roll your eyes at me when I say that, I really don’t think I have a basis to worry. In any case, it was a good weekend, because I felt refreshed and happy and bouncy come Monday (and you did too, because you wore cute clothes for the first time in a while).</p>

<p>Today though, you had a run in with the UBC Co-op bullies. How stupid. I can’t believe it’s someone’s job to be a butt. I’m also sorry that you had to run into that problem, and feel angry for no real good reason. It’s times like this when I wish that the distance wasn’t there, because I’m sure a hug would do what words can’t. I don’t feel great when you don’t feel great, and some of that is from not being able to do more on my end. I still think you handle problems really well, and I admire you a lot for that, because it’s something that I’m trying to get better at and now I finally have a role model to follow.</p>

<p>It’s just one of these times where all the things happening combined with all the different moods makes this just a little harder than it needs to be, but it does contribute to how much more I want to see you. It might not be fair to everyone else that if we get together, we can probably solve problems a little too easily, so maybe this is just our way of being nice and letting them have a head start.</p>
