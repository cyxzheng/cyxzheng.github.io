    <p>We got to a really really late start, mostly because it was really hard for us to get out of bed. We would move, sit up, and just stay there for a few minutes doing things to each other. Even after we got off the bed, we just leaned against a wall. We were basically two horny teenagers.</p>

<p>We met up today with my friend Lydia for brunch? Lunch? It was really late. Her boyfriend Nick also came. We sat down and immediately she pointed out our matching Champion hoodies, and then when we pulled our phones out with the matching cases, she lost her mind. That made me feel very happy that we’re “that” couple, but also we’re “that” couple by choice, and not because one of us forced the other to do anything. It just feels very natural, and very enjoyable.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was rainy and cold, but we still managed to find somewhere to sit and take selfies in (Cafe Tommy), and we also tried to shop, but unsuccessfully, because everything was closing. We were going to try Kazu, but the line was pretty long, so we decided to go to Kinka Izakaya instead.</p>

<p>Apparently, it was everybody’s birthday today. Lots of yelling, but it was amusing to tucked away and feed each other while everyone else is too caught up in their own celebrations to judge us. Or maybe some people did. Still felt quite natural.</p>

<p>It was a great day. It’s so nice to just be able to go somewhere with you, and enjoy every moment of it.</p>
