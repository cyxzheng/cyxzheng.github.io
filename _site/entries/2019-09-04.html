            <h3>Back to school</h3>
            <time class="date">September 4, 2019</time>
            <p>I’ve settled in, and it’s been about a week since I’ve moved back to school. It’s so weird to be in class again, and I feel like a complete outsider. Sorta like transferring schools in Grade 12 or something. Everyone already has their own groups. But to be honest, it’s nice not to be accountable to anyone. I can come and go as I please.</p>

<p>I feel very sad to be so far away from you. It feels like the first time, when you went to Ottawa. I know I sleep late, but part of that probably has to do with maximizing the time I get during the day with you. It’s just an adjustment, because now our schedules are no longer the same everyday, from 9 - 5 (or 6, or 7), and I know it’ll change throughout the year, and honestly, the unpredictability of it all scares me a little. I wish I could feel the sense of security I feel when I’m with you.</p>

<p>It’s a new challenge, but we’re not exactly new to challenges, are we? In a way, I’m glad we get to go through all of this, because we won’t keel over and die when the slightest breeze blows our way.</p>

<p>I knew going back to school would happen eventually. I never planned for it to happen exactly at the same time as you, because I didn’t plan for you at the time I decided to take a break from school. The timing and everything worked out though, and I’m glad at the very least I graduate at the same time you do. I’m imagining what if I didn’t have you, and came back to school - I’m sure I’d feel lonelier than I do now. What would I be working towards? Probably the same things, but just not with as much motivation.</p>

<p>This is all necessary, and even though it hurts sometimes, it’s still much better than living life without you. It’ll be routine soon, and it’ll be over in a flash.</p>
