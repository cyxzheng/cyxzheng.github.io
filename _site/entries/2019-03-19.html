            <h3>Tough conversations</h3>
            <time class="date">March 19, 2019</time>
            <p>I did my Microsoft interview today, and so this one is a bit late. But even if I’m a bit swamped, I need to remember this.</p>

<p>We had over the weekend another one of those moments where we felt really insecure about certain things. A breadth vs depth kind of insecurity. You cared that I’d make comparisons, and in return, I also did, but the funny thing I guess is that we only have these insecurities because we care so much about each other. I think I managed to sum it up to just wanting to be the best person for each other.</p>

<p>You are definitely the best person for me, so I hope I can be that for you. These are tough conversations, but I’m glad that we can have them. Really. It makes me really happy knowing that I can tell you my worries without worrying about being judged.</p>

<p>I wish we could just be with each other, because some of these things would be much easier if I could hold you.</p>
