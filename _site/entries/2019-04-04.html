            <h3>Syncing cycles</h3>
            <time class="date">April 4, 2019</time>
            <p>This is one of those weeks where we’re both just not having a good week. I guess we’ve synced our cycles.</p>

<p>I am feeling useless this week. I feel like my output is useless at work, and that probably made me feel useless when it came to you having a bad day and me not being able to do anything about it. The thing that would have helped, which was a hug, is about two weeks away. Quite the fun place to be in.</p>

<p>I feel like I feel this way because I care about you… a lot… but I also need to learn that you do have your own way of dealing with these things, and to not look at you in the stupid way that I did in Vegas. I’ll do my best to be the one good mood you can turn to on crappy days. I’m really glad you tell me these things and I hope I don’t ever make you feel the need to start hiding it from me, because that’s one of my favourite things about you, the fact that you’re honest with me about everything. As much as we all hate to hear things that are not about rainbows and unicorns, I still appreciate that you tell me the things I need to hear. Really reinforces why I need you.</p>

<p>I hope despite the fact that I can’t help you with homework or make you feel better all the time doesn’t mean I’m useless. I don’t think I am. I hope. I do feel it this week, but it’s just a bad week. You make the worst weeks bearable though, so please never leave me. I’m not sure what I’d do without you.</p>
