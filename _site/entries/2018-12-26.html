            <h3>Pretending to know how to snowboard</h3>
            <time class="date">December 26, 2018</time>
            <p>Skiing (or in my case, snowboarding)… something I didn’t foresee myself doing for a while. But then again, a lot of things happened this year that I didn’t foresee, so this one was probably the most normal one.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun today, and I’m really glad I got to go with you. Thanks for being so accommodating as I slowly got to grips again with how this whole thing works - I promise I’ll be a bit less stop-and-go as we go more often.</p>

<p>This was a day of contrast. We started at McDonalds, went up to Grouse, exercised for the first time in months for a few hours, calmly walked around to look at lights, and had ramen downtown, all in the same day, and all of these activities completely different from each other. I enjoyed every single minute of it with you, and it makes me think that if we can be happy doing anything, no matter how tiring, how extreme, or how mundane, then… what’s there to worry about? You mentioned that you worried one day we will think “ugh, this person again”, but I doubt that it will happen. I can’t explain why, but… just a feeling. Sometimes gut feelings are correct.</p>

<p>I hope we can both live a very fulfilling life, filled with both adventures as well as quiet time. I want to look back at everything we’ve done and be able to go “wow, we really didn’t waste those date vouchers” - and I think we’re doing a pretty good job so far.</p>
