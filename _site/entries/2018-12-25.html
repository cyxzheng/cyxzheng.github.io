    <p>Your unfortunate nap where you woke up at 10 pm allowed us to open both our presents at the same time via FaceTime!</p>

<p>Let me just say that I’m pretty much over the moon with your present. I haven’t had a real big LEGO set probably in… ever. Always had small to medium sized sets. I’m also a terrible person to get presents for because I don’t even know what I want, and somehow you knew exactly what I wanted without me knowing that. And… the fact that you noticed for just half an hour that I was calm and happy… well, I wasn’t aware that I was calm and happy when building my LEGO, but you noticed it - how thoughtful of you to encourage me to always take care of myself. My life has probably improved tenfold since four months ago.</p>

<p>I’m also really happy you like your gift. I really almost got a strap, but thought at the last minute that a metal bracelet would be more versatile. This really was a butt-clenching gift to give, because everything was more-or-less a wild guess… even if they were slightly educated wild guesses. For all the distance, I hope I can leave you reminders of me in your life in convenient (and also useful) places - all the effort we put in hopefully culminates in one day ending up together, happily ever after.</p>

<p>This was the best Christmas Day I’ve had in a long time. Thank you for making me feel loved. If you didn’t get me anything and told me that you were my present, I would have wholeheartedly agreed.</p>
