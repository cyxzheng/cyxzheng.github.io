            <h3>The confession of my feelings</h3>
            <time class="date">February 20, 2019</time>
            <p>Your Toronto weekend made me very happy. I was glad you got to explore and do things around the city that I called home for 8 months. I did really wish I was there with you though, so that I could take you around to my favourite places, but also discover some new ones with you.</p>

<p>It was also a good weekend because you kept me company every night. Yes yes, I know you tell me that I’m keeping you company, but the one constant in my life is you, and being able to see you gives me warmth and security.</p>

<p>I never know if you fall asleep or not until a little while after I stop talking and you don’t respond. I realized that I could just say whatever I wanted, and you wouldn’t know. Almost like talking behind your back, but to your face, and all nice things.</p>

<p>The thought of being with you for the rest of my life was something that’s been on my mind for a long time, but I thought this was something too early to say, in case I freaked you out. When you woke up and asked me what I said, I definitely started sweating nervously, but I figured it would be good to tell you because I really wanted to just let you know how I felt.</p>

<p>I told you that I could see a future with you, and that I’d be more than happy to spend the rest of my days with you. I want you by my side for all of the wonderful moments, as well as the challenging ones.</p>

<p>Thankfully, you were very happy to hear that, and told me that you thought that too. A big sigh of relief from me, and also happiness, knowing that I’ve found joy that lasts me the rest of my life.</p>
