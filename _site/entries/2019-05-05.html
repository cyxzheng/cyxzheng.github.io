    <p>What an interesting sight to behold.</p>

<p>Alice was very hung over this morning, but we went for brunch anyways at Vive la Tarte. It was supposed to be an interrogation, but I don’t think she was in any mood to do that.</p>

<p>It’s interesting because we both have experienced being like that probably more than once, so witnessing it from an outsider’s perspective was something new. Honestly, I thought I would miss alcohol and getting drunk (and it is fun to get drunk for sure), but I definitely do not miss the feeling of the day after. I’m really not sure how I got through those days… and at some point, I’m really not sure how I managed to do multiple days where I felt like that.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to now, we’re both not drinking, and less fat, and hopefully happier than we were 8 months prior, and it got me to think that if you weren’t around, where would my motivation be to fix myself? I think I mostly drank because I felt like I needed to feel better than I already did at that moment, and I guess being drunk was a way to temporarily forget about how poorly I felt when sober. It wasn’t healthy, not like I was healthy in the first place, but at the time I probably could care less, because who did I have to care about besides myself? And since I didn’t care about myself, I chose the route of self-destruction.</p>

<p>It’s a lot different nowadays. I don’t really have a reason anymore to want to be drunk, and because you’re here now, there’s some motivation there to do better for my own sake, and so that I can say that I deserve you. I like who I am when I’m with you, and that’s saying a lot, because I don’t think I’ve really ever liked myself much in the time that I’ve been alive.</p>

<p>I think life was always a little meaningless up until now. Now, I know that I want a future with you, and there’s suddenly a thing to work towards… giving up bad habits feels like the logical step towards that.</p>

<p>We’ve come pretty far, haven’t we? If you really think about it, I think we’ve both taken steps towards being better people for both ourselves, and for each other.</p>
