            <time class="date">November 23, 2018</time>
            <p>Winter holiday festivals are always the same every year. The same lights, attractions, food… the difference this year was that I got to go with you.</p>

<p>I think we’re both still getting used to this taking pictures together thing. Understandable, since it’s not like we have a chance to practice normally anyways. We did get a few nice photos; I think we look good together. Took a while though, because only one person knew how to take photos properly.</p>

<p>I know I wish that spending time together is something we can always do, but I guess the one benefit of waiting is that it just feels that much more special when it happens. When you know that you don’t get unlimited hugs/kisses/time spend holding hands, you make it count.</p>

<p>I’m glad we decided to spend the four days together. Even now it doesn’t feel like quite enough time.</p>
