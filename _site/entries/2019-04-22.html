    <p>Going home day for me. Nnnnnnnnn.</p>

<p>Ottawa airport was so empty today that I got to go through the gate at the latest possible moment. You were also able to watch my plane take off. That’s not too bad, I guess, as it’s much less sad than the other airport goodbyes we’ve had.</p>

<p>I don’t really have much to write for today, as most of my day was spent on a plane. It does however, feel like no time passed at all for this long weekend. Seriously, where did all the time go?</p>

<p>I’d like to think that every day that passes with you is one day closer to being together. One day closer to buying just a one-way ticket to wherever you are.</p>

<p>This weekend really felt like we picked it up where we left off in January, but with a 200% boost in confidence. I really can’t dream of being with anyone better than you, so you’re here to stay with me. I know I’ve hit the jackpot, and I’m not about to throw away this winning ticket.</p>
