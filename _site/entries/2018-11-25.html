            <h3>I love you</h3>
            <time class="date">November 25, 2018</time>
            <p>It was a shorter day, and also the last day before I see you again a little less than a month later.</p>

<p>Brunch plans proceeded without a hitch, thanks to Wildebeest being right beside Catch 122. We really went extravagant today and got bottomless mimosas, and also tipping more than 20%. Good to indulge ourselves if it’s this rare, so no complaints from me.</p>

<p>We were definitely at least slightly drunk at 2 pm, but everything just becomes so much more fun that way. It was so much fun making boomerangs together, and putting them up at the same time. I’m sure even the people who don’t follow us both can figure out that the other person in the story is someone special. We’ll keep them wondering, it’s more fun that way.</p>

<p>It was a calmer end to the day after our 2 hour session of debauchery at brunch. Hot chocolate, and a walk to Canada Place to have us both come to the realization that this visit ended way too quickly. It was probably on both our minds how daunting the new year will be, and I’m not sure any amount of words could really describe our fear of the unknown. I believe in us though, and I think we’re both strong enough to make this work. I think we both have the will to fight for what we want.</p>

<p>The walk to the car did not end with me awkwardly not giving you a kiss. Instead, it was a lot of kisses. It was something I didn’t want to end, but dinner reservations with my family was unfortunately not flexible. I’m really sorry I made you cry… again… I was dying on the inside because I didn’t want to say goodbye either.</p>

<p>I used to think that maybe I just had an icy cold heart, or that I just wasn’t someone who was into the whole compassion thing. I thought this way because I always felt like it would be a chore doing nice things for people, or that I had to do them because I was obligated to. Couple that with being told mean things about myself by someone who I was with meant that the occasional nice things I was being told were things that I had a hard time believing. With you, it’s different; I never really feel like I’m obligated to do nice things for you, but I do it because it makes me happy seeing you happy. Thank you for being someone I can try to be great to, and for softening up my heart.</p>

<p>The second goodbye at the skytrain station was even harder. I’m not sure how many times I pulled you back, and how many times you also walked back after walking away for a bit, but I didn’t remember it being this difficult at the airport. I’m happy I got to tell you that I love you, and I’m even happier that you feel the same way (and didn’t reply with a “thanks”, or worse yet, a “okay”). I think I knew before this day, but I wanted to tell you in person. I think it means more.</p>

<p>Feelings are such a strange thing. I’m not sure you can really define them, but I think as long as it feels right to us, it’s real. It’s nice taking things at our own pace.</p>
