            <h3>Insecurities</h3>
            <time class="date">February 21, 2019</time>
            <p>I came home two minutes after your good night text, but I really wanted to hear your voice, so I called you for about 2 minutes but actually it was more like 2 hours. Where does the time go when our conversations start?</p>

<p>We talked about something difficult for both of us, involving insecurities. For me, it was never having dealt with ex’s before, so I now sometimes hear voices in my head comparing me to your ex’s even though I know rationally there’s a reason they’re your ex’s. For you… I feel like it’s a bit more severe than mine, in that you felt like my ex was here during my formative years, and that she’ll forever be an important part of my life. And while you didn’t know me during that part of my life… I’m not sure you’d be attracted to the me of that time.</p>

<p>While it’s true she was there during those years, there’s a reason that period of my life ended and you started a new one. You’re an important part of my life, and will continue to be, and I’m certain this period of my life with you in it has no end date.</p>

<p>I’m sure we won’t kill these worries that fast, but it’s worth remembering that our past experiences led us to each other, and made us who we are now… and it so happens that we fit together really well. You have all the power to influence our future together, and I trust you fully. We build each other up and I can see that you do your best for me everyday; how could I ever want to let you go?</p>
