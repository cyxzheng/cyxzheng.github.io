    <p>This was “ride a bike around Stanley Park” day.</p>

<p>Things did not unfortunately go without a hitch. We went to Zabu Chicken and the waiters forgot to put in our order… so we waited about an hour for chicken to come out. The chicken was good, but I had to begrudgingly accept that, because I was really unhappy with the way that they basically didn’t even show a sense of urgency for messing up. Unfortunately (fortunately?) I’m not really one to make a scene in public, so we just ate and left.</p>

<p>Biking itself was really fun. I’m glad my mom gave me the chance to learn how to bike all those years ago, because it’s such a good skill to have for situations like this. This includes things like skating, or rollerblading… all things deemed unacceptable for guys to not know how to do.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went to a sketchy McDonald’s to get soft serve and fries. We sat by English Bay for a bit, before I drove you home.</p>

<p>I somehow thought today would be a day that I could get you home earlier than 11… and I was wrong again. There’s just something about spending time together that makes it go by so fast.</p>
