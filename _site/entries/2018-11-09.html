    <p>I met a new group of people today that were my age thanks to my Google friend. Half of the group preferred Mando over English.</p>

<p>I was talking with one of them on the way to karaoke, and the topic went to Tinder (I think she was talking about A/B testing different profiles… the things designers think about I guess). Of course that led to a talk about relationships, and of course that meant I brought you up. She remarked “天津人不错!”, but she also agreed with the whole stance on relationships where the two people should be their own person.</p>

<p>How fortunate I am to have you. I had no idea it was possible to have someone that could bring me up instead of putting me down; I really thought that was a prerequisite for all relationships. I don’t think I could ever take you for granted.</p>

<p>And of course, I still miss you dearly. I try to say it when I really can’t not say it. Don’t want it to lose its meaning heh.</p>
