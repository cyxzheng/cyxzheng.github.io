<p>Today was a day where the weather decided it would be fun to prank us. Right after we got the umbrella from your car, it stopped raining. I did get to see UBC properly for the first time though, and what better person to give me that tour than you?</p>

<p>What I really liked about today was how we took everything at our own pace. No schedules, no deadlines, no “must be here at this time” nonsense; it was a lot more enjoyable this way, I think. Enjoying each other was much more important than what we did or ate, and I like that. I hope that attitude towards everything we do continues; life seems much happier this way (minus the actual important ones… I don’t think we can be so chill about something like catching a flight).</p>

<p>It really feels like I’m learning how to date again. It’s a lot of fun, especially when I can surprise you; I hope I can do that for you for… I guess ever? I also do tend to lose track of who I am and I forget about almost everything I want to say when you’re with me, because how can I possibly focus when you’re right in front of me being super distracting with how captivating you are? I don’t mind getting lost like that though; it’s a happy feeling.</p>

<p>There’s something about kissing each other and being able to feel little things like the breathing, small body movements, rhythm… it’s a good thing that I want more of that, right? The movie theater back row was nice and dark, but I think we realized true privacy will always win out. Soon, though, a lot sooner than we expected.</p>

<p>What an amazing day. I love following loose plans, with the flexibility to improvise. Never a dull moment spent with you.</p>

<p>And… I’m sorry for making you cry with the gift cards. But I’m really glad you like them! I hope by the time you read this, you really will have visited me, and that I really will have been able to take you to those places.</p>
