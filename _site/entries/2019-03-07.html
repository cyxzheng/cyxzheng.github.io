    <p>Today was our 6 months! At the beginning, I thought that 6 months, let alone a year, felt like such a long ways away, but the day came and went at an amazing speed.</p>

<p>In the last 6 months, we:</p>

<p>Saw each other on 17 days</p>

<p>Travelled together once</p>

<p>Spent many weekends together over FaceTime/FB/Skype</p>

<p>Probably racked up a lot of server costs for those companies</p>

<p>Talked every single day</p>

<p>Missed each other single day</p>

<p>Decided with sufficient evidence that we’ve found “the one”</p>

<p>The extremely accurate statistics don’t say too much, but the point is, even with that small hurdle of being at least a few hundred miles away from each other, we’ve gotten closer to each other than I could’ve possibly imagined on Sept 7, 2018. The more I learn about you, the more time I spend with you, the more we talk about… all of that adds to how much I love you. You’re no longer an ideal, because all the things I could’ve possibly wanted are all real.</p>

<p>There was also a slight hiccup today with Jeffery Zhao. I don’t like him (or the way he talks to you), but I’m definitely not mad at you for keeping around a toxic friend. I know it’s hard to let that go. I’m proud of you for trying to not get yourself back into this hole today by removing him. I will support you 100% all the time, and will always be honest with you, especially for the difficult to talk about things.</p>

<p>Here’s to many more 6 months</p>
