            <h1 id="what-is-hvf-labs">What is HVF Labs?</h1>

<p>HVF Labs is Max Levchin’s startup studio, based in San Francisco, California. HVF stands for “hard, valuable, fun”, which are the kinds of problems that should be worked on at HVF Labs.</p>

<p>Companies such as Yelp, Affirm, and Glow have come out of HVF. You may have heard of them.</p>

<h1 id="my-role">My role</h1>

<p>I was responsible for the design of the new website, as well as the implementation. I worked alongside our Chief of Staff to figure out the content and messaging we wanted on the new website.</p>

<h1 id="figuring-out-what-to-fix">Figuring out what to fix</h1>

<h3 id="what-we-started-with">What we started with</h3>

<p>(insert image here)</p>

<p>The old website was meant to resemble a code terminal. It was very text heavy, and very orange.</p>

<p>Some testimonials from people who have visited the website:</p>

<p>(image with quotes)</p>

<p>The website lacked credibility, and that hurt our prospects for potential new hires and entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3 id="lets-bounce">Let’s bounce</h3>

<p>We had Google Analytics set up, so we took a look at a few statistics. We wanted to see the average bounce rate, session duration, and pages per session. This would tell us how many people left without doing anything on the website, how long they stayed, and how much content they read.</p>

<p>(insert image with stats)</p>

<p>Of the visitors who didn’t immediately leave our website, the majority went to the About page next. We assumed that these were the small subset of people who were interested enough to learn about what HVF Labs does.</p>

<h1 id="our-objectives">Our objectives</h1>

<h3 id="attract-new-talent">Attract new talent</h3>

<p>We need to hire the people who will become founders of the company they start at HVF Labs. The output of this objective should be a clear and compelling website that properly explains what HVF Labs does, and how it’s done.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-website-fully-editable">Make the website fully editable</h3>

<p>The new website’s content needed to be easily modifiable without knowledge of how HTML.</p>

<h1 id="content-based-design">Content-based design</h1>

<p>Before I went full speed ahead making potential page designs, we sat down to figure out what we wanted to say.</p>

<p>What we wanted to touch on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What we’ve created</li>
  <li>What we do</li>
  <li>How we do it</li>
</ol>

<p>The old website actually did a very good job of expressing HVF Labs’ methodology and conviction, so we took that copy, stripped out the superfluous content, and used this copy to put together a website structure.</p>

<p>(image of home, about)</p>

<p>The home page would act as the hook, where HVF Labs proven track record and unique way of starting companies would hopefully entice potential talent.</p>

<p>The about page would then dive deeper into how HVF Labs operates, and who would provide support and guidance.</p>

<p>The bottom of each page would have a call-to-action, allowing the prospective candidate to reach out to HVF Labs. A careers page is also visible on the navigation, linking to our Angelist page.</p>
