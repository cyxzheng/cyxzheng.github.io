            <h1 id="research">Research</h1>

<p>I came up with 5 questions that I asked to 10 fellow undergraduate students. I wanted to figure out what was important to them when it came to joining student organizations, how they search for them, and whether or not they ever considered proposing a new organization.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why do you join student organizations?</li>
  <li>What’s important to you when picking an organization?</li>
  <li>How do you search for organizations to join?</li>
  <li>What makes you decide/not decide to join an organization that’s interesting to you?</li>
  <li>Have you ever considered starting an organization? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="insights">Insights</h1>

<p>I gathered answers and summarized my findings, taking note of how frequently the same responses would come up. There was a good amount of overlap between experiences, even at different schools.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Question5.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h1 id="finding-core-problems">Finding core problems</h1>

<p>My initial research showed that most people have an idea of their interests when searching for organizations. I narrowed down what I found into three core problems:</p>

<h3 id="1-its-hard-to-know-where-to-start-looking">1. It’s hard to know where to start looking</h3>

<p>Physically checking out different booths on Clubs Day and searching online are both overwhelming, because of the abundance of choices available.</p>

<h3 id="2-details-about-an-org-arent-always-clear">2. Details about an org aren’t always clear</h3>

<p>My school has a directory for all organizations, but it doesn’t include information needed to join, such as meeting times and locations. Every organization has a different way of managing their online presence, which sometimes makes it difficult to find the most updated information.</p>

<h3 id="3-proposing-an-org-is-a-daunting-and-confusing-process">3. Proposing an org is a daunting and confusing process</h3>

<p>Looking at different universities, the procedures are all quite lengthy, and somewhat intimidating, but I was able to piece together a general process after looking at the procedure from about 10 different schools.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Proposal.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>When there’s no easy way to search through a catalogue of student orgs, finding out if your idea has a duplicate can be daunting, especially at the larger schools with 600+ student orgs.</p>

<h1 id="solving-the-problem">Solving the problem</h1>

<p>To help new students <strong>browse, search, and propose new student organizations</strong>, I’ve decided to achieve it with these three goals in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make it easy for students to find orgs based on their interests and values</li>
  <li>Provide clear information about each org</li>
  <li>Make the proposal process less daunting</li>
</ol>

<p>The experience being designed should should aim to fulfill these.</p>

<h1 id="ideation-and-wireframes">Ideation and wireframes</h1>

<p>I broke down the different unique screens that students might see, in order to better understand what I needed to design.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/HLFlow.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>I went ahead and fleshed out the user flow in Sketch. I chose to design for web, as it’s incredibly difficult nowadays to convince users to download your app. Typing in a URL is a considerably lower barrier to entry, and developing for web ensures access from almost all devices, as long as they’re connected to the internet.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Flow.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>You can view the full size image <a href="/assets/images/projects/google/Flow.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are three sections in the navigation, each with its own unique purpose.</p>

<h3 id="1-browse">1. Browse</h3>

<p>This is where the user looks for organizations that are interesting to them. Recommended for You is a curated list based on user-specified interests, and All Organizations is simply a list with all the options available.</p>

<h3 id="2-favorites">2. Favorites</h3>

<p>The Favorites section allows users to save organizations for future reference. The Your Interests subsection allows users to keep track of proposed (but not yet formed) organizations that they’ve expressed interest in.</p>

<h3 id="3-up-and-coming">3. Up-and-coming</h3>

<p>Up-and-coming shows proposed organization ideas that users can “show interest” in, as new organizations being formed need to show that there’s demand. Users can also come up with their own proposals that hopefully garner interest, get submitted, and eventually approved.</p>

<p>Finding and proposing student organizations can be a more dynamic process, as we can take into account a student’s interests, and break down processes to prevent information overload.</p>

<p>A couple things come together to make this possible, starting with when the student first logs into the portal.</p>

<h3 id="1-make-it-easy-for-students-to-find-orgs-based-on-their-interests-and-values">1. Make it easy for students to find orgs based on their interests and values</h3>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Onboard.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>You can view the full size image <a href="/assets/images/projects/google/Onboard.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some things have to be determined in person, such as if a user gets along with other members of an organization. Other things, like a user’s interests, we can ask.</p>

<p>The onboarding takes a user’s interests and values, and shows matching organizations up front; this eliminates the need to do blind searches, or to scroll through every category in the school directory.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Explore1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>The Recommended page shows all the results relevant to the user’s interests. This view allows them to very quickly see their options, saving time, and also showing them organizations that they otherwise might have missed if they were manually searching.</p>

<p>The All Organizations page is a collective list of every single student organization. Users, now without the need to look out for organizations relevant to their interests, can browse through the rest of the organizations and allow some to (hopefully) catch their eye.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Explore3.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>What about the users with interests for which no organizations exist? The Up-and-Coming section shows all proposed organizations. Users can “show interest” to the organizations they want to become a reality.</p>

<p>Each proposal card will show the amount of interest garnered, as well as an expiry time. Each proposal will expire after a month, as that should be sufficient time for aspiring organizations to establish a potential member base.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Explore4.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>Users can also search for organizations using keywords. This will take into account proposed organizations as well, so that if a search turns up no results, the user can see potential options that they can pledge interest to, so that even if the organization doesn’t exist at the current time, they can do their part to help it form in the future.</p>

<h3 id="2-provide-clear-information-about-each-org">2. Provide clear information about each org</h3>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Explore2.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>Each organization will have its own page, with accompanying descriptions and pictures. There’s an opportunity here to paint an image of what membership entails, and can give potential members an idea of whether or not this organization will benefit them and provide the community that they’re seeking.</p>

<p>Important information, such as meeting times, location, and fees, are present on this page, for every single organization. This will reduce confusion, and in turn drive participation, as users won’t have to wonder if the meeting room they’re wandering to is truly the right location.</p>

<h3 id="3-make-the-proposal-process-less-daunting">3. Make the proposal process less daunting</h3>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Propose.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>You can view the full size image <a href="/assets/images/projects/google/Propose.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Duplicate organizations are generally not allowed, as the idea must be original.</p>

<p>The user picks the categories and subcategories that their proposal might fall under, and similar organizations will be shown that match the user’s choices. Presenting potential duplicates upfront reduces the need for a manual search, eliminating the daunting tasks of searching through potentially hundreds of existing organizations to find one that is too similar.</p>

<h1 id="high-fidelity">High-fidelity</h1>

<p>I designed with desktop in mind, but didn’t forget about mobile users. A responsive grid was used to ensure that this is useable on any device.</p>

<h3 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h3>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Onboard2.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>The onboarding process is designed so that the user can scan through the choices quickly. No other content is present, other than the question and possible answers.</p>

<p>A “Next” button is placed here because the form allows for multiple selections, so the user should move forward only when they’re ready.</p>

<h3 id="browse">Browse</h3>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Browse.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>The Browse page presents relevant organizations up front, with a featured picture that gives the user a better sense of what the organization is all about. Each organization is its own card, as they all contain unique information.</p>

<p>A floating action button on the top right allows the user to edit their interests, which in turn will change what’s being displayed on the Recommended page.</p>

<div class="case-image"><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="/assets/images/projects/google/menu.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></div>

<p>The navigation drawer is left open by default on a desktop view, for the sake of visibility to the user. The user can choose to toggle it open or closed.</p>

<p>Tabs enable lateral navigation within each page, allowing for the switch between subcategories of content.</p>

<h3 id="organization-details">Organization Details</h3>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Details.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>The Details page contains relevant information about an organization. A small gallery gives the user a preview of what membership might entail. Allowing each organization to provide more details besides a basic description will hopefully encourage more use of this platform, which in turn should result in the important details being updated more often.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Up-and-coming.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>The Up-and-coming page containing organization proposals is laid out largely the same as the Browse page, but with a dismissable reminder upon first use that informs the user these organizations are not real… yet.</p>

<p>Cards are not split into different category sections, due to the unpredictable nature of what organization proposals might be active at any given time; each proposal’s category will be on its own card instead. Each card also has the addition of a “# interested” tag, to show the current level of interest, as well as an expiry timer at the bottom.</p>

<h1 id="a-cool-to-have">A cool-to-have</h1>

<h3 id="i-follow-my-friends">I follow my friends</h3>

<div class="img-grid">
<div class="grid-image-3"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Friends1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>
<div class="grid-image-3"><img src="/assets/images/projects/google/Friends2.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>
<div class="grid-image-3"><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="/assets/images/projects/google/friends.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></div>
</div>

<p>Many people answered during the research phase that they would consider joining and organization if they had friends in it. Unfortunately, it seems that universities generally don’t allow logging in with social media, so it’s not feasible to show friends who are part of an organization you might be interested in.</p>

<h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1>

<p>There’s a definite opportunity here to expand beyond simply searching for and proposing student organizations. If I had more time, I would explore beyond simply searching for and proposing organizations, as this could potentially be a centralized hub for all student-related activities, events, and news, not just limited to student orgs. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts!</p>
