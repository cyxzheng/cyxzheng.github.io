            <p>The team and I at Halleman Bradley aim to be at the center of a consumer's financial life, challenging the perception that banks don't work for their customers. By utilizing technology and leveraging data, we can provide a better, friendlier product than what currently exists on the market. </br> </br> I started with Halleman Bradley at the earliest stages, leading design for the company and moving us closer to 1 from 0.</p>

            <h1 id="the-current-problem">The current problem</h1>

<p>Currently, the US banking industry is dominated by a few meganational banks, who hold around 40% of all deposits. All these banks provide basic services to customers, such as holding deposits, being FDIC insured, and offering credit/loan products.</p>

<p>Have banks been delighting consumers? Net Promoter Scores seem to suggest no. As well, consumers believe that their bank isn’t doing work for them.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/nps.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h1 id="my-role">My role</h1>

<p>I am the lead solo design for our company, <a href="https://www.hmbradley.com/" target="_blank">Halleman Bradley</a>, and for this project, the <a href="https://launch.trycrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux mobile banking app</a>. I was responsible for designing our product from the ground up, building a design system, talking to customers to gain insight, and all other design-related needs, such as branding and graphic design.</p>

<p>I worked alongside our principal engineer, CEO, and COO. Everyone had valuable insights on certain aspects of our product that I took into account when making decisions.</p>

<h1 id="finding-our-north-star">Finding our North Star</h1>

<h3 id="whats-currently-available">What’s currently available?</h3>

<p>Right now, banks are just “good enough”, which is hardly awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Newer fintech bank solutions such as Chime and Simple have done a great job with the user experience and customer experience of their product, but primarily target the unbanked and underbanked demographic. We want to target the full-stack traditional bank customer who wanted a full range of financial products beyond a basic checking account.</p>

<p>The current market for financial products also has the consumer going to different companies for different needs, as financial services are mostly unbundled.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/unbundled.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="where-we-aim-to-be">Where we aim to be</h3>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to be the first place a consumer goes for any financial product, need, service, or advice, and the best way to lay the foundation for that was to become a bank.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/bundled.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h1 id="setting-a-foundation">Setting a Foundation</h1>

<p>It would be impossible for us to jump to 100 right away from 0, so we focused on figuring out what we needed to do to get to 1 first.</p>

<p>There were three things we needed to do to lay out a solid foundation for our future:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand what’s important to customers.</li>
  <li>Compete with the best apps in terms of UX.</li>
  <li>Create products and services that are valuable to our target demographic of working millennials who prioritize saving.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="what-do-customers-value">What do customers value?</h1>

<p>It was good for us to sit in a room and brainstorm, but we’re not our customers. We needed to see what people wanted in their bank, and decided to find this out by testing a few different landing pages through Facebook ads.</p>

<p>We were looking to test what messaging and value propositions would land us the highest conversion rate of people who actually sign up for our waitlist after visiting the page.</p>

<h3 id="landing-page-1">Landing page #1</h3>

<p>Our first landing page, where we thought paying people to bank with us would garner interest. As it turns out, $3 a month + 1% interest wasn’t a big enough value proposition for people to switch.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/landing1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="landing-page-2">Landing page #2</h3>

<p>Our approach with this landing page was to hit on the pain points that most people had with their bank. Things such as fees, processing times, opening hours… all annoyances that add up.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/landing2.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>We decided to keep “Love Your Bank” as our primary landing page, as it had the highest conversion rate at 35%. The rate climbed up to 40% for a while a few weeks into the campaign.</p>

<p>What was interesting was that this landing page didn’t offer any value propositions in the form of incentives or interest rates. The promise of convenience, empathy, and solutions to many common pain points in banking seemed to have struck a chord amongst customers, so this was the messaging that we decided to pursue going forward.</p>

<h1 id="making-it-real">Making it real</h1>

<p>We were starting to get some traction with our waitlist signups, and our goal wasn’t to be stuck in waitlist limbo for the next three years, so I started to work on our mobile banking app.</p>

<p>No matter what new innovations in consumer finance we come up with, people still have basic everyday banking needs. I did some analysis of the mobile apps from some of the big banks, and from some of the new fintech banks, to see what parallels in services they offered.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/comparisons.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>Regardless of what the apps looked like, or how they functioned, we were able to find common features.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/commons.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>We wanted to offer an exceptional user experience in comparison to existing banking apps, so it wasn’t enough to just stuff these features into our app and call it a day. My goal at this point was to put together an MVP that we could test, in order to validate two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We’re not missing any features that are deemed necessary for day-to-day banking</li>
  <li>We meet our goal of offering a friction-free user experience</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="early-insights">Early Insights</h3>

<p>We asked around the office about what people usually did when it came to using their banking apps. Some things like checking account balances required no interaction besides logging into the app, while other actions such as depositing checks or transferring money between accounts required user input.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/interaction.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>I decided to run tests on the “Move Money” features, based on what we determined above. “Goals” would be tested as well, but separate from “Move Money” due to it being a separate feature (despite also moving around money).</p>

<p>I made wireframes and tested them in-house with employees from other companies sharing our incubator space. I wanted to test with waitlist customers later when we had something higher fidelity, so that they could focus on the functionality and not the visual design.</p>

<p>I listed out the flows I wanted to test, along with its accompanying question. I chose to create a scenario for the user, with the hopes that it would provide better context than simply “do this, do that”.</p>

<h3 id="move-money">Move Money</h3>

<p>The tasks pertaining to moving money were some of the common things people needed to do on their mobile banking app.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/movequestions.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>Moving Money proved to be a relatively straightforward process, with the majority of comments referring to wording being confusing in some spots.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/movetest1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/goals.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>Goals was more complicated, and the whole process was wrought with mixed feelings.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/goaltest1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/goaltest2.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>No one liked feeling guilty for having to take money out of a goal, or for not committing to a goal, because life happens and it’s never good to feel worse about circumstances that might be out of control. In many cases, people said that they were actually less likely to set goals because they didn’t want to feel guilty.</p>

<p>I took this feedback and applied it to my design, with the intention of testing version 2 with users that were signed up on our waitlist.</p>

<h1 id="testing-with-waitlist-customers">Testing with waitlist customers</h1>

<p>I reached out on our Facebook page, asking if anyone wanted to take part in testing our mobile app. The response was extremely enthusiastic, and I was able to schedule 15 user tests that happened in the span of a week.</p>

<p>This time, I also added Bill Pay to the list of things I wanted to test, along with Goals and Moving Money.</p>

<p>I also included the sign-in flow, both to test, and to ease users into testing the actual feature by giving them the feeling that they’re testing a real banking app.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/login.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>All tests after the login flow would lead them to the home screen. This screen serves as the entry point for all the features being tested.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/home.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="testing-move-money">Testing “Move Money”</h3>

<p>These features have to do with managing funds in one’s account.</p>

<p>We want to test that our check deposits feature works as well. Check deposits is probably the most innovative feature in mobile banking apps in the last decade. It’s a necessary feature, especially if we start out with no physical branches.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/depositcheck.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>Before we open physical branches, we wanted our customers to be able to meet the majority of their needs through our mobile app. Sending checks, paying friends, and setting up direct deposits are things that people need to do not on a day-to-day basis, but can be a major inconvenience if it needs to happen on short notice. It was important for us to make sure that these features worked as intended, and that our customers were aware that they existed.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/movemoney1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="post-testing-insights">Post-testing insights</h3>

<p>Almost everyone we tested with was confused by what “Move Money” meant, and almost no one tapped on “Move Money” first when looking for a feature within it. We changed it to “Pay &amp; Transfer”, and the resulting test was much more successful.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/transfersfix1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<p>When paying friends, most people wanted to search for a contact, but didn’t see the search icon. We changed it to a search bar to increase visibility.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/transfersfix2.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="testing-goals">Testing “Goals”</h3>

<p>Savings goals was a feature we didn’t see too much of in other places. Our API supported this feature, so it was easy enough to implement on our end. We also saw a lot of enthusiasm for this feature, and some customers already had ideas about what they could save for if they had this feature in their current banking apps.</p>

<p>I tested adding a goal, adding to a goal, and cashing out a goal.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/goals1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="post-testing-insights-1">Post-testing insights</h3>

<p>The one thing everyone was confused by was the screen where they could “Kickstart” their goal, by adding an amount to it so they don’t start the goal at $0. Most people were expecting to set the goal end date/amount being saved per period/saving frequency, so we moved the kickstart screen to the end of the adding process. Testing it again resulted in less confusion.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/goalsfix.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="testing-pay-bills">Testing “Pay Bills”</h3>

<p>Being Canadian, I thought that the bill pay system would be similar in America. I was used to adding my bills to my mobile banking app, and my bank would ACH the funds to that account. What ensued was that people were… not used to this way of doing things.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/bills1.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="post-testing-insights-2">Post-testing insights</h3>

<p>It turns out from talking to our customers that most people pay their bills from external sources. It would be a feature that makes sense down the line, but right, it’s difficult to pay every single bill from one source due to differences in how different merchants set up their billing.</p>

<p>We changed focus to having customers be able to pay the rare bill that requires sending a check instead. This also put our bill pay feature in the spotlight, where you can take a picture of a bill, and it’ll fill out all the details for you. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/billsfix.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="some-other-observations">Some other observations</h3>

<p>Wording is also very important, as customers had terms that they were familiar with when dealing with financial products. It was also equally important to sound human, as customers were delighted when they came across a button that said “Very Nice” instead of “Confirm”.</p>

<p>Not presenting information overload was also crucial. Having more screens was better than packing one screen with 4 different sets of instructions. People generally moved through the flows pretty quickly, so having an extra screen or two for the sake of clarity wasn’t the worst thing in the world.</p>

<h1 id="other-visual-things">Other visual things</h1>

<h3 id="icons-that-spark-joy">Icons that spark joy</h3>

<p>Transactions are not the most interesting thing in the world to look at. They’re not always the easiest thing to decipher sometimes, as well. I created an icon set for all the transactions categories laid out for us in the API, with hopes that it will make transactions easier to scan and understand.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/icons.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="illustrations-that-delight">Illustrations that delight</h3>

<p>There are a lot of different states, and again, we want to be a friendly, approachable bank. I made some colorful illustrations to add delight to otherwise empty screens, and to visual convey information.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/illustrations.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h1 id="creating-further-value">Creating further value</h1>

<p>We looked to improve upon or innovate new features that would provide value, and through conversations with our waitlist customers, we came up with a few things were small in nature but had a big impact on the customer experience of our product.</p>

<p>Please note that some of these designs are intended to be used as a proof-of-concept for our vision and potential investors. User testing was not done on all of these.</p>

<h3 id="instant-apple-pay">Instant Apple Pay</h3>

<p>Normally, you’d wait about a week before receiving your debit card after opening up a new bank account, so in order to alleviate some of the inconvenience, we would make it so that your debit card is available for use on Apple Pay right away.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/applepay.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="savings-leaderboard">Savings leaderboard</h3>

<p>We want to attract savers, and also be different from other banks who prioritize making people spend money. By encouraging people to save money, we’ll build a base of fiscally responsible customers who can also turn into responsible borrowers.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/savingsleaderboard.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="advanced-bill-pay">Advanced bill pay</h3>

<p>Bill pay should be simple, and not require you to manage it from a multitude of external sources and merchants. As well, you should be able to feel safe paying for things, which is where one-time use credit card numbers come into play.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/billpay.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="push-credit">Push credit</h3>

<p>The traditional way of applying for credit is… applying, and you’ll take a hit to your credit score for each hard inquiry. Financial institutions have a lot of information about its customers, so why not use it to constantly underwrite them? Through soft credit pulls, as well as analysis of a customer’s financial transactions, we can determine if someone is creditworthy and offer them products automatically for them to just take - no application needed.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/pushcredit.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="adaptive-rewards">Adaptive rewards</h3>

<p>Most credit cards have a rewards system that is very fixed, with cashback categories that never change. We feel that your rewards should adapt to what you spend the most money on.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/rewards.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h3 id="financing-transactions">Financing transactions</h3>

<p>Credit card APRs are ridiculous, and it would be a big relief for some if they could finance certain individual transactions for a small monthly fee.</p>

<div class="case-image"><img src="/assets/images/projects/crux/finance.png" data-zoom="zoom" /></div>

<h1 id="lessons-and-takeaways">Lessons and takeaways</h1>

<p>Every grand vision that turns into reality has to start from somewhere. Our goal is still ultimately to be the center of everyone’s financial lives, but to start, we need to build a product that meets everyone’s needs, and then some.</p>

<p>When building something from 0, the process is rarely linear. A lot of it is figuring things out along the way, and the important thing is to validate it by talking to people outside of the office. I found that every customer was at a different level of financial literacy and had different needs, so it was good for us to keep them in the loop throughout the design process.</p>

<p>Constant communication is extremely important when working with engineering. All my design decisions I made with consultation to our principal engineer, as I needed to know if certain things were possible to build on his end. The speed at which our app is being built is due to no misunderstandings about what is and isn’t feasible.</p>

<p>The product and company will continue to evolve. Currently, we’re in the pre-launch stage, pending investments. Until then, <a href="https://launch.trycrux.com/" target="_blank">sign up</a> for our waiting list so you can be notified when we launch the bank of the future.</p>
