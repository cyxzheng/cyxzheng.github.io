    <h1>Hi, my name is Calvin. I'm a designer with a passion for storytelling.</h1>
    <p>I've spent time in some cool places â€” <a href="https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html">Manulife</a>, <a href="https://www.weareintersect.com/">Intersect</a>, <a href="https://hvflabs.com/">HVF Labs</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.</p>
    <p>I love design systems, and making things come to life with motion. I believe a strong visual and motion story is extremely important in making a product feel delightful and complete.</p>
    <p>I'm currently looking for new grad opportunities starting Fall 2020. If I look like someone you won't murder on day 2, please reach out!</p>
