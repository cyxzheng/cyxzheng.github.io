    <h1>Hi, I'm Calvin.</h1>
    <p>I've spent time in some cool places â€” <a href="https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html">Manulife</a>, <a href="https://www.weareintersect.com/">Intersect</a>, <a href="https://hvflabs.com/">HVF Labs</a>, <a href="https://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, and along the way I've developed a passion for storytelling, design systems, and motion design. I've also helped start a <a href="https://hmbradley.com">company</a>, currently in pre-launch.</p>
    <p>I love making things come to life with motion, and building out a cohesive design system. I believe a strong visual and motion story is extremely important in making a product feel delightful and complete.</p>
